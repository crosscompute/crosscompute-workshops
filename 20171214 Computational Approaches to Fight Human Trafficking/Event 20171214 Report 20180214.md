## How It Started

In an [article published on December 2011](http://www.governing.com/blogs/bfc/new-york-city-performance-data-analytics.html), John Feinblatt described how Mayor Michael Bloomberg had tasked a team with the mission of helping NYC agencies solve city problems by analyzing city data to prioritize limited resources. Inspired by the article, I found that Michael Flowers of the Financial Crime Task Force was leading this team in the Office of Policy and Strategic Planning and contacted him in February 2012. For nine months from April 2012 until December 2012, I worked alongside Ben, Catherine, Lauren and Nick on a primarily pro bono basis, trying to persuade the team to use Python and CrossCompute instead of Excel or SAS by showing the analysts how easy it was to [merge tabular data using pandas, filter spatial data using shapely and fill missing data using scikit-learn](https://crosscompute.com/n/mclCK1IUHD67gF5JQ0l9SnBRM7yidp6v). Though I had previously experienced success from 2007 to 2011 in converting a research team at Columbia University to use Python, getting the analysts in the NYC Mayor's Office of Policy and Strategic Planning to actually use Python and CrossCompute in their work was more difficult than I anticipated, despite official support and encouragement from the team.

The [original plan was for the city analysts to create useful tools they made with city data and to share these tools on the CrossCompute platform for other city analysts to run](http://news.crosscompute.com/post/18614886521/your-algorithm-can-be-useful-to-people-around-the-world). CrossCompute was designed as a platform for running user-contributed tools, analogous to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com) or [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store) but with a focus on open data and the public sector. However, creating a tool from start to finish was technically challenging on early versions of CrossCompute. After months of making example tools and preparing training material for the staff, I abandoned the original plan of having the analysts publish their own tools and instead spent most of my time working on platform architecture.

By mid-2012, Accenture, SAS and Palatir were constructing a cross-agency city data warehouse (which came to be known as [DataBridge](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/analytics/initiatives/citywide-data-sharing.page)) to parallel what had been done decades earlier in the private sector. I strongly believed that it would be easier to recruit city analysts if we made Jupyter Notebook available as a Python/R/Julia interface to the datasets in the warehouse and submitted a proposal to the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications in September 2012. Understandably, there was a lot of resistance from the stakeholders contractually obligated to design and build the city data warehouse as the open source languages and platforms presented a threat to the proprietary platforms involved. The official reason for rejecting the proposal was that there were security concerns in providing an alternate interface to the warehouse. I learned that technical merit alone could not sway decisions in large organizations and government in particular was subject to a complex network of competing interests and influences from the private sector.

Frustrated by government processes, dwindling savings and pressure from Cathaleen (who did not want to live in New York), I refused an offer to develop the embryonic NYC Open Data initiative and instead opted to move to California and work in the private sector. I was careful to choose a position that would not be a conflict of interest with the CrossCompute platform and tools that I wanted to continue building. In January 2013, I chose to work as a Sales Engineer for Google AdSense in order to aid online publishers and gain a deeper understanding of the business aspect of technology. As intended, the role had minimal overlap with my experience building satellite image recognition and spatial optimization systems but also had minimal overlap with my motivations and interests. Within weeks, I was miserable. I missed working alongside a driven team whose mission was to demonstrate how to use city data to help agencies protect the health and safety of a city and population about whom I cared deeply.

With approval from the company to work for a few weeks in New York in December 2013, I suggested a reunion of the [original team that had become the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/nyregion/mayor-bloombergs-geek-squad.html).

    talk about how the spatiotemporal analysis for community health and safety meetup started
    talk about how we had some events in California but how it was difficult to find a venue in New York

    talk about how olga wanted us to present at meetups and eventually host our own meetup
    talk about how in april 2017 olga had drafted a list of meetups where we could present
    talk about how we had difficulty presenting at other meetups specifically learn python nyc and nyc python meetup

    talk about how i talked about human trafficking with eric during a long walk in september
    i told eric how i knew yuliya
    talk about how yuliya suggested the dataset problem -- this is when the event officially started
    talk about how i invited aida to a nyc python meetup and she started working on usa doj court cases for the dataset

## How We Prepared

    Though the idea of the event started in September 2017, work on the event did not begin in earnest until October 2017.
