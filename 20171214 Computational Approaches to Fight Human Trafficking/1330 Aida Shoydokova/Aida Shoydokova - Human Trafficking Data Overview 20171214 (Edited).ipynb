    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### There is a huge need for the development of solutions for better collection, measurement, analysis, sharing and transparency of data on Human Trafficking [[1](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1546-Report.pdf?mc_cid=f863d1d5d4&mc_eid=3e6d3fcc42)]. There are significant gaps in knowledge of how to prevent human trafficking remain. Additional efforts and resources for research, data collection, and evaluation are needed to identify those actions most effective to prevent victimization [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current State of Human Trafficking:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Insufficient data**. Insufficient quality data is being collected by all organisations especially by businesses- around potential incidents of slavery, how slavery affects them and vice versa. There is no clarity on what data is required and on gaps in data. Reliable data collection from victims and survivors could help build the best datasets [[1](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1546-Report.pdf?mc_cid=f863d1d5d4&mc_eid=3e6d3fcc42)] \n",
    "* **Limited data sharing**. Datasets are being used in silos and not efficiently shared across law enforcement and civil society organisations to improve the collective response. Issues around data privacy protection and security inhibit a systematic sharing of data. A better understanding of how to use existing regulatory regimes in a manner consistent with human rights standards would be beneficial [[1](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1546-Report.pdf?mc_cid=f863d1d5d4&mc_eid=3e6d3fcc42)] \n",
    "* **Inconsistent measurement**. Analysis of datasets is only worthwhile if sufficient data points can be accurately compared. This relies on the quality and consistency of how data points are measured. Few agreed norms and standards for measuring modern slavery characteristics exist at local, regional, national and international levels [[1](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1546-Report.pdf?mc_cid=f863d1d5d4&mc_eid=3e6d3fcc42)] \n",
    "* **No Comprehensive Analysis**. There are need for analytical tools to collate datasets from different sources and apply AI/Data Science to spot connections [[1](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1546-Report.pdf?mc_cid=f863d1d5d4&mc_eid=3e6d3fcc42)]. Big data analytics could have an impact in identifying and analysing migration flows of vulnerable people and identifying patterns [[1](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1546-Report.pdf?mc_cid=f863d1d5d4&mc_eid=3e6d3fcc42)]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas for Process Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a reliable baseline information, data, and research that illuminates the causes, prevalence, characteristics, trends, and consequences of all forms of human trafficking in various countries and cultures [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]\n",
    "* Measure impact of antitrafficking prevention strategies to make accurate assessment of the impact of policies and assistance programs, including unintended negative consequences [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]\n",
    "* Identify populations vulnerable to human trafficking [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]\n",
    "* More comprehensive understanding of root causes that are specific to states, communities, and cultural contexts. [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]\n",
    "* Understand unique vulnerabilities or break downs [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]\n",
    "* Find trends [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]\n",
    "* Understand migration: source and destination countries, as well as along migration routes[[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges aka Opportunities \n",
    "* Most of the populations relevant to the study of human trafficking are part of a “hidden population”, i.e. it is almost impossible to establish a sampling frame and draw a representative sample of the population. [[1](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1546-Report.pdf?mc_cid=f863d1d5d4&mc_eid=3e6d3fcc42)]\n",
    "* Given the complex nature of human trafficking, it is difficult to amass reliable data to document local, regional, and global prevalence [[2](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf)]. "
