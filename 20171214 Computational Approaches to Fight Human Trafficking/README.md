## Method
- In September 2014, Professor Yuliya Zabyelina mentioned that she had been researching issues related to human trafficking.
- In September 2017, Eric Schles described some of the approaches he had taken to help investigators fight human trafficking.
- In October 2017, Professor Zabyelina suggested that a dataset of human trafficking incidents from court cases and news articles would be useful. Civic Hall offered to host our event at their venue.
- In November 2017, we introduced the guest speakers to each other. Aida Shoydokova started analyzing U.S. Department of Justice court cases. The Python Software Foundation awarded a grant to PyLadies NYC to co-host the event. Our team posted flyers at universities and ordered catering from Fresco Tortillas.
- By December 2017, several work sessions and team rehearsals resulted in a workable agenda. However, there were harrowing last minute changes to the workshop content and CrossCompute platform, mostly to handle spaCy's huge memory footprint. We invited the PyLadies NYC organizers to introduce each guest speaker.

## Results
We had a total of 44 recorded participants, not including Civic Hall members and staff who were working at their desks.
- 3 guest speakers
- 5 volunteers
- 17 participants from PyLadies NYC
- 19 participants from EventBrite

8. Roy Hyunjin Han, Computational Engineer at CrossCompute, encouraged the audience to [create computational tools to influence policy](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-workshops/blob/master/20171214%20Computational%20Approaches%20to%20Fight%20Human%20Trafficking/1345%20Roy%20Hyunjin%20Han/Roy%20Hyunjin%20Han%20-%20You%20Can%20Create%20Tools%20to%20Influence%20Policy%2020171214%20(Edited).pdf), then started participants on a [self-guided introduction to building a dataset from U.S. Department of Justice court cases using Python](https://crosscompute.com/n/BhkK4AlpPD4Hmn8O0mbDtrH0q4HzphfN).

![Roy Hyunjin Han introduces the hands-on workshop](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/1/9/7/600_475584983.jpeg).

9. Salah Ahmed, Software Engineer at CrossCompute, was in the audience and guided participants during the workshop. Yao Kou, User Experience Designer at CrossCompute, was also in the audience.
10. Jennifer Ruda, Project Manager at CrossCompute, took photos and gathered handwritten feedback from participants using a [printed questionnaire](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-workshops/blob/master/20171214%20Computational%20Approaches%20to%20Fight%20Human%20Trafficking/Agenda%2020171214.pdf) and compiled the feedback into categories.

- What did you like the most about this meetup?
    - Topic combining human trafficking and data analysis
    - Presentations, particularly the domain overview provided by Professor Zabyelina
    - Building computational tools to fight human trafficking
- What do you think we should have spent more time on during today's event?
    - Clearer instructions on how to get involved
    - Opportunity to interact with speakers and other participants
    - Step-by-step walkthrough of datasets and code during hands-on workshop
- What did you like the least about this meetup?
    - Workshop needed a clearer goal
    - Workshop needed to focus on one analysis
    - Workshop needed to guide people through creating code rather than just running existing code
- How can we improve our CrossCompute website and/or platform?
    - Have the landing page be clearer about what the platform does
    - Walk the user through the steps of uploading a notebook
    - Walk the user through the steps of running a tool

## Conclusion
Here is what we did well:
- We partnered with well-established groups to attract participants.
- We gathered written feedback using a printed questionnaire.
- We prepared a checklist for the day of the event.
- We reserved a separate room where we can test our presentations and store our bags.

Here is what we would like to improve:
- Begin organizing a workshop only after the content is complete.
- Put external speaker content on CrossCompute at least one month in advance.
- Limit workshops to at most one guest speaker.
- Be strict about ending talks that have exhausted their grace period.
- Be clearer about communicating what CrossCompute is and how it can be useful.
- Have participants actually write code during the workshop instead of just running pre-written code.
- Prepare a way for participants to continue contributing after the event. Several participants told us they wanted to help, but we did not know how to respond or how to organize a follow-up effort.
