## How It Started

- In September 2014, Professor Yuliya Zabyelina mentioned that she had been researching issues related to human trafficking.
- In September 2017, Eric Schles described some of the approaches he had taken to help investigators fight human trafficking.
- In October 2017, Professor Zabyelina suggested that a dataset of human trafficking incidents from court cases and news articles would be useful. Civic Hall graciously offered to host our event at their venue.

## How We Prepared

- In November 2017, we introduced the guest speakers to each other. Aida Shoydokova started analyzing U.S. Department of Justice court cases. The Python Software Foundation awarded a grant to PyLadies NYC to co-host the event. Our team posted flyers at universities and ordered catering from Fresco Tortillas.
- By December 2017, several work sessions and team rehearsals had resulted in a workable agenda. However, there were harrowing last minute changes to the workshop content and CrossCompute platform, mostly to handle spaCy's huge memory footprint. We invited the PyLadies NYC organizers to introduce each guest speaker.

## What Happened

1. Olga Creutzburg, Director of Business Development at CrossCompute, welcomed the audience.
2. Reshama Shaikh, Co-Organizer of PyLadies NYC, explained the code of conduct and introduced Yuliya Zabyelina.
3. Yuliya Zabyelina, Assistant Professor at CUNY John Jay College, presented an overview of human trafficking from a criminal justice perspective.
4. Antonia Blair, Co-Organizer of PyLadies NYC, introduced Eric Schles.
5. Eric Schles, Adjunct Professor at NYU SCPS, walked through a Jupyter Notebook analyzing child labor.
6. Samantha Falk, Co-Organizer of PyLadies NYC, introduced Aida Shoydokova.
7. Aida Shoydokova, Data Scientist at American Express, described her experiences applying web scraping and natural language processing to process U.S. Department of Justice court cases using Python.
8. Roy Hyunjin Han, Computational Engineer at CrossCompute, described how we can use

# !!!

We had a total of 44 recorded participants, not including Civic Hall members and staff who were working at their desks.
- 3 guest speakers
- 5 volunteers
- 17 participants from PyLadies NYC
- 19 participants from EventBrite


- We gathered written feedback from participants.

    Talk about burnout
    Talk about taking photos

## What We Did Well

- We gathered written feedback from participants using a printed questionnaire.
- We prepared a checklist for the day of the event.
- We reserved a separate room where we can test our presentations and store our bags.

## What We Could Improve

- Begin organizing a workshop only after the content is complete.
- Prepare speaker content on CrossCompute at least one month in advance.
- Limit workshops to at most one guest speaker.
- Signal clearly when a speaker has gone over time and be strict about ending talks that have exhausted their grace period.
