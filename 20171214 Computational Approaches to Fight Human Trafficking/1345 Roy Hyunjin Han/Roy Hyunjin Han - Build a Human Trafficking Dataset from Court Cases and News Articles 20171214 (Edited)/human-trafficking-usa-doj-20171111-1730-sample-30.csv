Ishii to 12 years and seven months in prison for sex trafficking of a minor, United States Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner announced. Andrade’s co-defendant Javier Solis is scheduled to be sentenced August 24, 2015.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Andrade and Solis forced two girls, ages 15 and 17, to perform sex acts for money first in Fresno and then in San Luis Obispo. In addition, the 15‑year-old girl was taken to a tattoo parlor in Fresno where the defendants’ nicknames were tattooed on her, one name on each shoulder.                                                                            </p>

<p>Court documents further reflect the 17-year-old, a runaway, spoke with Fresno Police officers on October 24, 2013, after her mother brought her home from San Luis Obispo. While being interviewed, she told officers about the 15-year-old who was still in San Luis Obispo under the control of the defendants as well as the motel where she was staying. In response, the San Luis Obispo Police Department was contacted, and officers were able to successfully remove her from that location.</p>

<p>“Collaboration, such as occurred here between federal, state, and local agencies, is the key to stopping human trafficking networks. We are pleased with the guilty pleas and the message that this tough sentence sends to anyone involved in sex trafficking of minors. We will continue to be vigilant to seek out and take down the perpetrators of human trafficking by using the collaboration of our anti-human trafficking task force,” stated Dan Dow, San Luis Obispo County District Attorney.</p>

<p>This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Fresno Police Department, the San Luis Obispo Police Department and the San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office. Assistant United States Attorneys Michael Frye and Mia Giacomazzi are prosecuting the case.</p>

<p>This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the United States Attorneys’ Offices and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute those who sexually exploit children, and to identify and rescue victims.

Thanks to the FBI, Fairfax County Police  Department and the members of our Northern Virginia Human Trafficking Task  Force, his operation is shut down and can no longer victimize these girls.”    </p>         <p>            “Recruiting, exploiting and  transporting juveniles for the purpose of underage prostitution is a cruel form  of modern-day slavery,” said Assistant Director in Charge Parlave. “Prostitution  is not a victimless crime.  The FBI is committed to apprehending  individuals who sexually exploit juveniles, and we will continue to work to  identify these predators and their victims.”</p>         <p>            According to a statement of facts  filed with his plea agreement, since August 2007, Barcus has led and organized  a commercial sex organization that has prostituted at least 23 women, including  at least four of whom were 16 years old and at least three were 17 years old  when Barcus began prostituting them. He targeted juveniles who had run away  from home or lived in a broken home, sometimes making them believe that he or  other members of the organization were romantically interested in them. Barcus  also stated that he purchased clothing and shoes for girls he wanted to recruit  as a means of luring them into the venture.</p>         <p>            Barcus admitted that he used  Backpage.com and other erotic internet sites to advertise the girls’ services  and to recruit girls to work for his organization. When the girls found it  difficult to repeatedly have sex with strange men, Barcus and others provided  them with alcohol and narcotics to make them more vulnerable and susceptible to  prostitution.</p>         <p>            Barcus and other conspirators  carried and, when necessary, brandished firearms while engaging in  prostitution-related activities, and Barcus battered at least three of the  females working for his commercial sex enterprise. At times, Barcus had the  women and girls he prostituted tattooed with his nickname: “Boo.”</p>         <p>            In November 2012, Barcus was  prostituting at least one juvenile in Herndon, Va., while another member of his  organization was prostituting other females in Atlanta, Ga. Because the venture  was yielding substantial profits in Herndon, Barcus instructed the conspirator  to bring two 17-year-old girls to Herndon. When one of the girls objected, she  was told that “under the rules of the game” she had to go to Virginia. Barcus  admitted that each girl servicing clients in Herndon could obtain $500 or more  per day. All of the money was turned over to Barcus or other members of the  enterprise.       </p>         <p>This case was investigated by  the FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Fairfax County Police Department,  with assistance from the Northern Virginia Human Trafficking Task Force.

<p><strong>DALLAS</strong> — Justin Dishon Brathwaite, 27, of Dallas, Texas, appeared in federal court today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Renee Harris Toliver and pleaded guilty to one count of transportation of individuals to engage in prostitution, announced John Parker, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas.</p>

<p>Brathwaite, who remains on bond, faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine. Sentencing is set for June 17, 2015, before U.S. District Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn.</p>

<p>According to documents filed in the case, in early May 2012, Brathwaite called 19-year-old “Jane Doe,” after seeing her on Backpage.com in Oklahoma City. Jane Doe and Brathwaite spoke on the phone for about two weeks, and Brathwaite invited her to come to Dallas to live with him. He promised to take care of her if she moved to Dallas to be with him and told her she should stop engaging in commercial sex acts. Jane Doe agreed to the move.</p>

<p>On May 12, 2012, Brathwaite drove from Dallas to Oklahoma City, picked up Jane Doe and returned to Dallas. Once they arrived in Dallas, Brathwaite told her she needed to begin immediately to make money for him, or he would drop her off somewhere and leave her. Jane Doe eventually agreed to work at a strip club and engage in commercial sex acts. Brathwaite posted ads featuring her on Backpage.com, and he made Jane Doe give him all of the proceeds from her commercial sex acts. Brathwaite took Jane Doe to various cities in Texas, including Denton, Killeen, Houston and Austin.</p>

<p>On June 12, 2012, the Dallas Police Department’s vice unit encountered Jane Doe in a hotel room in Dallas and arrested her for prostitution. The investigation led to Brathwaite’s involvement in her commercial sex acts.</p>

<p>The FBI investigated. Assistant U.S. Attorney Cara Foos Pierce is prosecuting.</p>

<p><strong>PANAMA  CITY, FLORIDA </strong>–Jacobo  Feliciano-Francisco, a/k/a “Kiko”, age 32, was   sentenced in United States District Court yesterday to spend the  remainder of his life in prison after he was convicted of kidnapping,  retaliating against a witness, conspiracy, and transportation and of an  individual in interstate commerce for prostitution.  The sentence was announced by Pamela C. Marsh,  United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.</p>         <p>The female victim in this case had previously cooperated  with the FBI after being forced and coerced by others to work as a prostitute between  2009 and 2011.  Due to that cooperation,  a total of 13 individuals were convicted in Tennessee and Kentucky of various  federal sex-trafficking and prostitution criminal charges.  Following her cooperation with law  enforcement, the victim and her family were relocated to Panama City Beach,  Florida, out of concern for their safety.</p>         <p>In retaliation for her cooperation as a prior Federal  witness, Feliciano-Francisco and others tracked down her location, repeatedly  threatened the physical safety of both her and her family, kidnapped her, and  transported her to a brothel in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, with the intent that  she would be forced back into prostitution.  During her kidnapping, Feliciano-Francisco not  only verbally threatened and intimidated the victim, but he physically  terrorized and humiliated her when he sexually assaulted her.  After arriving in Hattiesburg, the victim  escaped Feliciano-Francisco and led police back to the brothel where he was  arrested.</p>         <p>“Prosecuting  human traffickers is a top priority for this U.S. Attorney’s office and the  Department of Justice,” said U.S. Attorney Marsh.  “Congress has given us strong laws to go  after this heinous crime, which is often difficult to find and prove because  traffickers enforce silence among their victims through coercion and violence,  as happened in this case.  Despite those  threats, however, the victim showed tremendous bravery in coming forward to help  bring this defendant to justice.  We  commend her for her courage and pledge to continue this important fight against  this modern form of slavery.” </p>         <p>This  conviction results from an investigation by agents of the FBI, U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, and the Hattiesburg  Police Department, and was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Katy  Risinger.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                		 		             </div>                   </div>                       </div>",False,True

<p>Upon completion of their sentences, each defendant will be turned over to the Department of Homeland Security for deportation.  Cruz Vidal has already been deported from the United States.  Lazaro Juarez-Juarez, 34, of Atlanta, Georgia, who was also indicted in this case, has not been apprehended.</p>

<p>United States Attorney Canova stated, “Combatting human trafficking is a priority of the Department of Justice and my office, and the trafficking of women for commercial sex is a significant part of the human trafficking problem that our country faces.  In this particular case, dozens of women were brought into the United States illegally and exploited by the defendants to engage in prostitution in several states for the defendants’ profit.  This office will continue to partner with our federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and vigorously prosecute the trafficking of vulnerable victims for sex.”</p>

<p>“Human trafficking is a violation of its victims’ civil rights, and infringes upon the protected liberties guaranteed to all Americans,” said Charles P. Spencer, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Jacksonville Division.  “This type of illegal activity demonstrates a very real risk to our local communities, and stopping it remains one of the highest criminal investigative priorities for the FBI.”</p>

<p>“Human trafficking is an abomination, and this criminal organization has devastated the lives of so many women,” said Susan L. McCormick, special agent in charge of HSI Tampa.  “These sentencings are the result of the hard work of our special agents and show the importance HSI places on investigating human trafficking crimes.”</p>

<p>This case resulted from a 15-month investigation into human trafficking activities in the Northern District of Florida by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Stephen M. Kunz.  It is a follow-up prosecution to a previous <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndfl/pr/human-trafficker-gets-life-prison""><u>kidnapping case</u></a> prosecuted in federal court in Panama City.</p>

Stickney to one count of sex trafficking of children, announced John Parker, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas.</p>

<p>Trenton McLemore, 29, faces a statutory maximum penalty of not less than 10 years and up to life in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.  However, the parties agree if the Court accepts the plea agreement, the appropriate term of imprisonment in this case is 252 months (21 years) in federal prison.  Sentencing is set for October 21,2015, before U.S. District Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn.</p>

<p>According to documents filed in the case, McLemore met “Jane Doe” and her family when she was 11-years-old.  In July 2013, when Jane Doe was 16-years-old, she ran away from home to be with McLemore, and the two began living in motels.</p>

<p>On August 1, 2013, McLemore began facilitating Jane Doe’s commercial sex acts in several ways.  He asked friends and family to rent rooms for them at a Super 8 Motel and a Motel 6 in the Dallas area for her to use with commercial sex customers.  McLemore also provided Jane Doe a cell phone for her to use to communicate with commercial sex customers.  McLemore often used that phone to communicate with Jane Doe’s customers, sometimes posing as her and texting her customers to arrange “dates” and then leaving the motel room shortly before the customer arrived.</p>

<p>McLemore also took sexually explicit photos of Jane Doe that he distributed via text message to potential customers.  Often, McLemore would stay near the motel room to act as Jane Doe’s bodyguard while she engaged in the commercial sex acts, and he would return to the room shortly after the customer left to collect the proceeds.</p>

<p>In mid-September 2013, a detective with the Irving Police Department conducting an operation to identify possible victims of human trafficking, found a commercial sex advertisement on Mocospace.com with photographs of a female who appeared to be underage.  He contacted the number, and after exchanging several messages regarding a potential commercial sex act, they agreed to meet on September 19, 2013, in a specific room at a Super 8 Motel in Irving, Texas.</p>

<p>As McLemore left that room shortly before the “date,” he was seen texting at the same time the detective was receiving messages about the “date.”  When the detective arrived and entered the motel room, Jane Doe agreed to engage in a commercial sex act with him.  She was then placed in custody and law enforcement determined she was a 16-year-old runaway from Dallas.</p>

<p>McLemore had stayed nearby while that “date” occurred, and his personal items were later found inside that motel room.  When law enforcement learned Jane Doe’s age, they arrested McLemore for compelling prostitution of a person under the age of 18 and human trafficking.  He has been in custody since that time. </p>

<p>The Irving Police Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), both members of the North Texas Trafficking Taskforce, investigated.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Cara Foos Pierce is in charge of the prosecution.</p>

<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. – Tammy Dickinson, United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Kansas City, Mo., announced that a Kansas City, Mo., man pleaded guilty in federal court today to child sex trafficking and producing child pornography, which was discovered during an investigation into an extortion and blackmail scheme.</p>

<p>Corey M. McKinney, also known as “Chef FireFlame Corey,” 36, of Kansas City, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Greg Kays. McKinney’s plea came during the second day of his trial on the charges contained in an Aug. 30, 2011, federal indictment.</p>

<p>By pleading guilty today, McKinney admitted that he was sexually active on numerous occasions with the child victim since she was 14 years old, identified in court documents as “CV.” McKinney, who was the legal guardian of CV, admitted that he used computers and video equipment to record sexual activity between himself and CV. McKinney also admitted that he caused CV to engage in prostitution as part of an extortion and blackmail scheme.</p>

<p>On March 24, 2011, McKinney was hiding in the bedroom closet while CV was having sex with a man identified in court documents as “John Doe.” John Doe had just met CV, whom he believed to be 17 years old, on Facebook the day before. McKinney secretly recorded the sexual encounter on his cell phone and on a nearby computer.</p>

<p>John Doe returned to the apartment the next day to have sex again. McKinney burst into the room, asking John Doe if he knew how much trouble he could get into because his sister was only 16 years old. John Doe did not know that the girl was actually 16 years old, or that McKinney had recorded the earlier illicit encounter. He did not know that the 16-year-old girl was not actually McKinney’s sister, but rather was a former neighbor that McKinney himself – a 34-year-old man at the time, a few years older than John Doe – had been exploiting sexually.</p>

<p>After demanding $500 in exchange for not exposing John Doe to his family, friends, employer, or the authorities, McKinney made John Doe go with him to a nearby ATM to get some form of this payment. John Doe was only able to pay $100 at that time and McKinney demanded that he pay the balance in the next few days.</p>

<p>After this encounter, John Doe received a flurry of text messages from McKinney, who made threats and demanded money. McKinney claimed he sent the video file to a friend who worked at a local news agency. He also attempted to confront John Doe by arriving unannounced at his home. After numerous texts and an attempted in-face confrontation, John Doe approached the authorities and advised them of the extortion attempts. The text message threats from McKinney continued, and soon John Doe learned that McKinney was posting information about him and his wife on his Facebook page. Eventually, an exchange was arranged (through the direction of the Kansas City Police Department) to pay the remainder of the money in exchange for a USB drive with the video on it.</p>

<p>On April 7, 2011, McKinney was arrested at DeVry University in Kansas City, Mo. (where he was a student) after he exchanged a USB drive containing the video for money that he had been demanding from John Doe. Evidence uncovered during the investigation included various videos and images constituting child pornography with McKinney engaged in sexual activity with the same child victim. When investigators searched the minor’s cell phone, they found several sexually explicit photos of McKinney and the minor as well as sexually explicit photos of John Doe and the minor.</p>

<p>McKinney admitted that while he was incarcerated after his arrest he called the child victim dozens of times in repeated efforts to get her to recant her prior statements and testimony and persuade her to submit a statement on his behalf in the hopes of getting the charges against him dismissed.</p>

<p>Under federal statutes McKinney is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in federal prison without parole, up to a sentence of life in federal prison without parole, plus a fine up to $500,000 and an order of restitution. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.</p>
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patrick D. Daly and Brian P. Casey. It was investigated by the Kansas City, Mo., Police Department and the FBI in conjunction with the Human Trafficking Rescue Project.</div>

<p><strong>SAVANNAH, GA</strong> – A federal indictment, unsealed today, has charged 12 defendants for their roles in an alleged sex trafficking and prostitution ring stretching from Georgia to Florida to North and South Carolina. The federal charges follow a lengthy investigation dubbed “Operation Dark Night,” which was led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Yesterday, in addition to a number of arrests and searches, federal authorities rescued 11 women alleged to have been forced into prostitution.</p>

<p>United States Attorney Edward Tarver said, “In what essentially amounts to slavery in the year 2013, the conduct described in the indictment against these defendants is reprehensible. Human trafficking is a cancer facing our society. This indictment confirms that the United States Attorney’s Office, HSI and other federal and state law enforcement agencies are taking an aggressive stand to stop the victimization of women involved in sex trafficking.”</p>

<p>“ICE investigates a wide array of crimes, but the trafficking of women and girls for prostitution is among the most sinister,” said ICE Director John Morton. “Few crimes so damage their victims and undermine basic human decency. Our fight against this evil must be relentless, both here and abroad.”</p>

<p>According to allegations in the Indictment, Joaquin Mendez-Hernandez, aka El Flaco, conspired with each of the defendants to transport people across interstate boundaries to engage in prostitution. In addition, Mendez-Hernandez allegedly conspired with at least three others to entice women from Mexico, Nicaragua and elsewhere to travel to the United States with false promises of the American dream. Once inside the United States, these women were allegedly threatened and forced to commit acts of prostitution at numerous locations in Savannah, Georgia and throughout the southeast. In one such instance identified in the indictment, Mendez-Hernandez is alleged to have told a Mexican woman that she would be sent back to her home country unless she serviced 25 clients a day.</p>

<p>A copy of the indictment is attached. Mr. Tarver stressed that an indictment is only an accusation and is not evidence of guilt. The Defendants are entitled to a fair trial, during which it will be the Government’s burden to prove the defendants’ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>HSI provides relief to victims of human trafficking by allowing for their continued presence in the United States during criminal proceedings. Victims may also qualify for a T visa, which is issued to victims of human trafficking who have complied with reasonable requests for assistance in investigations and prosecutions. Anyone who suspects instances of human trafficking is encouraged to call the HSI tip line at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (866-347-2423) or the Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888. Anonymous calls are welcome.</p>

<p>Operation Dark Night was led by HSI, with assistance from the FBI; the ATF; U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); CBP Air and Marine Operations; IRS-Criminal Investigations; the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department; the Chatham County Sheriff’s Office; the Garden City Police Department; and, the Chatham County Counter Narcotics Team. Assistant United States Attorneys Tania D. Groover and E. Greg Gilluly, Jr. are prosecuting the case on behalf of the United States.</p>

KHOBRAGADE is currently employed as the Deputy Consul General for Political, Economic, Commercial and Women’s Affairs at the Consulate General of India in New York, New York.</p>

<p>Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “Foreign nationals brought to the United States to serve as domestic workers are entitled to the same protections against exploitation as those afforded to United States citizens. The false statements and fraud alleged to have occurred here were designed to circumvent those protections so that a visa would issue for a domestic worker who was promised far less than a fair wage. This type of fraud on the United States and exploitation of an individual will not be tolerated.”</p>

<p>According to the allegations in the criminal complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:</p>

<p>Diplomats and consular officers may obtain A-3 visas for their personal employees, domestic workers, and servants if they meet the requirements set out in 9 Foreign Affairs Manual (“FAM”) 41.22. As part of the application process, an interview at the embassy or consulate is required. Proof is required that the applicant will receive a fair wage, sufficient to support himself financially, comparable to that being offered in the area of employment in the U.S. To apply for an A-3 visa, the visa applicant must submit an employment contract signed by both the employer and the employee which must include, among other things, a description of duties, hours of work, the hourly wage – which must be the greater of the minimum wage under U.S. federal and state law, or the prevailing wage – for all working hours, overtime work, and payment.</p>

<p>DEVYANI KHOBRAGADE prepared and electronically submitted an application for an A-3 visa (the “Visa Application”) through the website for the U.S. Department of State’s Consular Electronic Application Center for an Indian national (“Witness-1”), who was to be the personal employee of KHOBRAGADE beginning in November 2012 at an address in New York, New York. The Visa Application stated that Witness-1 was to be paid $4,500 per month in U.S. dollars. KHOBRAGADE and Witness-1 also signed an employment contract (the “First Employment Contract”) for Witness-1 to bring to Witness-1’s interview at the U.S. Embassy in India in connection with the Visa Application, which Witness-1 did at KHOBRAGADE’s direction. The First Employment Contract stated, among other things, that KHOBRAGADE would pay Witness-1 the prevailing or minimum wage, whichever is greater, resulting in an hourly salary of $9.75.</p>

<p>KHOBRAGADE knew that the First Employment Contract that KHOBRAGADE caused Witness-1 to submit to the U.S. State Department in connection with Witness-1’s Visa Application contained materially false and fraudulent statements about, among other things, Witness-1’s hourly wage and hours worked. Prior to the signing of the First Employment Contract, KHOBRAGADE and Witness-1 had agreed that KHOBRAGADE would pay 30,000 rupees per month, which at the time was equivalent to $573.07 U.S. At 40 hours per week, with approximately 4.3 weeks in a month, $573.07 equates to a rate of $3.31 per hour. However, KHOBRAGADE instructed Witness-1 to say that she would be paid $9.75 per hour, and not to say anything about being paid 30,000 rupees per month. KHOBRAGADE also instructed Witness-1 to say that Witness-1 would work 40 hours per week, and that Witness-1’s duty hours would be 7 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. She told Witness-1 that the First Employment Contract was a formality to get the visa.</p>

<p>After the First Employment Contract was submitted to the United States Department of State, KHOBRAGADE told Witness-1 that Witness-1 needed to sign another employment contract (the “Second Employment Contract”). KHOBRAGADE and Witness-1 signed the Second Employment Contract, which provided that Witness-1’s maximum salary per month including overtime allowance will not exceed 30,000 rupees per month. The Second Employment Contract does not contain any provision about the normal number of working hours per week or month.</p>

<p>Witness-1 worked for KHOBRAGADE as a household employee in New York, New York, from approximately November 2012 through approximately June 2013. Notwithstanding the terms of the First Employment Contract, Witness-1 worked far more than 40 hours per week, and Witness-1 was paid less than $9.75 per hour by KHOBRAGADE. In fact, notwithstanding the terms of the oral agreement between KHOBRAGADE and Witness-1 and the terms of the Second Employment Contract, Witness-1 was paid less than 30,000 rupees per month, or $3.31 per hour.</p>

<p>KHOBRAGADE, 39, was charged with one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements, which carry maximum sentences of ten years and five years in prison, respectively. She is expected to appear this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman.</p>

Anderson, 42, of Ellenwood, Ga., was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Thomas W. Thrash to serve 25 years in prison to be followed by seven years supervised release. Anderson was ordered to pay restitution to three victims totaling $154,500. Anderson pleaded guilty to the charges on July 19, 2013.</p>

<p> <br />
“This sentence makes clear that those who prey upon women and girls and coerce them into prostitution will be punished severely,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division. “The Department of Justice will continue to devote its full efforts to investigating and prosecuting those who commit such heinous crimes.”</p>

<p> <br />
“This defendant chose to earn a living exploiting minors, even continuing to do so after previously serving a federal sentence for sex trafficking-related conduct,” said U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates of the Northern District of Georgia. “Our office will remain vigilant in our efforts to prosecute those who exploit children and young women in this district.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>""Today's sentencing removes a dangerous individual from our streets who has repeatedly shown a callous disregard for the basic human rights of others,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Ricky Maxwell for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Atlanta Field Office. “Human trafficking and child exploitation cases such as this reaffirm the FBI's mission as we work to protect and help those that may not be able to help themselves.""</p>

<p> </p>

<p>According to U.S. Attorney Yates, the charges and other information presented in court, from February 2008 through December 2011, Anderson ran a prostitution ring in which he advertised the sexual services of a minor and young women on the internet, including K.B., T.B., A.C. and other victims. He advertised on sites such as Backpage, Craig’s List and Eros, as well as his own website, Rentsomethingsexy.com. Anderson caused K.B., a 17-year-old girl, to engage in commercial sex acts in multiple states, requiring her to earn $1,000 a day, work seven days-a-week and give all of her earnings to him. Anderson also transported 18-year-old T.B. and 24-year-old A.C. from Georgia to Virginia, where he required the young women to perform numerous commercial sex acts for his financial gain.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Anderson previously pleaded guilty in August 2001 to using a cell phone, which is a facility of interstate commerce, to cause a juvenile to engage in prostitution and to being a felon in possession of a firearm. He received a sentence of seven years in federal prison after providing information to federal investigators about other sex trafficking crimes and testifying at the trial of two other human traffickers. However, Anderson resumed his sex trafficking activities after completing his prison sentence.</p>

Santelle announced that United States District Judge Lynn S. Adelman has sentenced Milwaukee resident Troy Randle, age 37, to 20 years imprisonment following Randle’s conviction on two federal sex-trafficking counts. The sex-trafficking counts involved two separate minor females.</p>

<p>Evidence introduced at Randle’s sentencing showed that he began prostituting both of the child-victims when they were just 14 years old and that he prostituted them through their 17th birthdays until his arrest by federal authorities in January of 2014.  Further evidence introduced by the United States showed that Randle’s sex trafficking of these two minors took place in Milwaukee through street prostitution and at hotels; in Chicago, Illinois; Dubuque and Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Ft. Wayne, Indiana; and South Dakota.  Randle ordinarily accompanied the victim-girls to these cities and provided the transportation.  Randle controlled them through false expressions of love and loyalty as well as through his physical abuse of both.  Randle advertised the prostitution services of both victims through postings to Backpage.com.</p>

<p>In making this public announcement, United States Attorney Santelle stated:  “The sentence most appropriately imposed by Judge Adelman on this defendant is a genuine reflection of both the horrific victimization suffered by these two girls and the terrible impact that this type of criminal behavior has on the life and the well-being of our communities.”  Santelle stated further: “The investigation and prosecution of sex-trafficking cases in the Eastern District of Wisconsin is among the highest priorities of my office, and we will continue to pursue the perpetrators of this heinous conduct with all of the resources available to us.”</p>

<p>Randle was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Joseph R. Wall.  United States Attorney Santelle commended AUSA Wall and the partnered law enforcement agencies responsible for investigating Randle’s trafficking enterprise—namely, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Milwaukee Police Department, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>

Inspectors took  a sample of the wastewater, which was black in color.</p>         <p>Ohio  EPA personnel arrived at the facility on Feb. 1 and found that the unnamed  tributary had puddles of oil throughout its length, from where the stormwater  drained to the Mahoning River, approximately one mile away. Oil and an oily  sheen were also visible in the Mahoning River.</p>         <p>That  day, an EPA representative spoke with Lupo about the discharge into the storm  drain. Lupo admitted he directed a Hardrock employee to discharge the contents  of the storage drain into the stormwater drain, and further admitted that he  directed discharge from a storage tank a total of six times, according to the  affidavit.</p>         <p>Lupo  later told EPA and DNR personnel that he directed a Hardrock employee to drain  storage tanks at Hardrock into the nearby stormwater drain six times over the  previous six months, and that Lupo was the one who “gave the word” for the  storage tanks to be discharged, according to the affidavit.</p>         <p>On  Feb. 12, a Hardrock employee stated that the discharges began in November 2012  at the direction of Lupo and that the employee was aware of at least 20  discharges into the stormwater drain.

<p>Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney John P. Kacavas of the District of New Hampshire made the announcement.  U.S. District Judge Steven J. McAuliffe of the District of New Hampshire imposed the sentence.             </p>

<p>Derric Theoc, 36, was indicted by a federal grand jury in July 2013 and pleaded guilty in June 2014 to one count of attempted access device fraud.  In addition to his prison sentence, he was ordered to serve two years of supervised release. </p>

<p>In his guilty plea, Theoc admitted that, in April 2013, he attempted to purchase packages of personal identifying information for 100 people from an undercover United States Secret Service agent who was posing as a known, prolific vendor of personally identifiable information, Hieu Minh Ngo.  Theoc had previously made multiple similar purchases from Ngo. </p>

<p>Ngo, a Vietnamese national, pleaded guilty on March 3, 2013, to wire fraud, identification fraud and fraud in connection with access devices and on Aug. 21, 2014, to a separate indictment to four counts of computer fraud.  Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 1, 2014.  According to court documents, Ngo administered websites from 2007 through February 2013 that allowed more than 1,000 individuals from throughout the world to access databases containing personal identifying information and conduct more than 3 million queries to obtain a person’s date of birth, Social Security number and other information.  He also sold or transferred more than 150,000 packages of personally identifiable information that would allow criminals to take over the identity of another person.</p>

<p>The packages of personal identifying information that Theoc attempted to purchase typically included a person’s name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, mother’s maiden name, driver’s license number, bank account number, bank routing number, email account, account password and place of work.  Theoc further admitted that he attempted to purchase the information with the intent to obtain credit cards to make purchases or withdraw money and to file fraudulent tax returns in an effort to receive refunds to which he was not entitled.</p>

Moore, Special Agent in Charge of the United States Secret Service, Atlanta  Field Office.</p>         <p>          According to United States Attorney  Yates, the charges and other information presented in court:  From approximately February 1, 2011 until  November 15, 2012, the defendants conspired to manufacture and distribute  counterfeit U.S currency.  The defendants  focused on $50 bills, but also manufactured $20 bills. Heath Kellogg, a  self-taught graphic artist, developed a manufacturing process for counterfeit  currency. Smith helped Heath Kellogg manufacture the counterfeit currency, and  both men purchased supplies on various occasions. </p>         <p>          Smith  distributed the counterfeit currency through a network of individuals, which  ultimately spread the bills throughout the United States. Smith and Heath  Kellogg used feedback from their ultimate customers, who victimized businesses,  individuals and banks by passing the counterfeit currency in the community, to  refine and improve their manufacturing process over time. The defendants sold  the counterfeit currency to customers in exchange for genuine U.S currency, at  various discounted rates. </p>         <p>          On  November 15, 2012, Secret Service agents executed search warrants yielding a  wide variety of physical evidence, including completed and partially completed  counterfeit currency, a large roll of special paper of the sort used in  commercial printing presses, numerous printers, and a flash drive containing  encrypted digital files with high definition images of various features of the  counterfeit bills. </p>         <p>          The  counterfeiting operation was extensive. The Secret Service reports that  counterfeit currency matching the distinctive characteristics of those produced  by the defendants totaling over $1.4 million in face value has been returned to  it by local police departments, banks, merchants and individuals victimized  when the counterfeit currency was passed.   The counterfeit currency was returned to the Secret Service from victims  across the United States and internationally.</p>         <p>          Heath J.

The conspirators then purchased or stole reloadable gift cards and scratched off or otherwise damaged the magnetic strips on the back of the cards so that they could not be read by merchants’ point of sale (POS) terminals. The conspirators used an embosser to emboss the stolen account numbers and their own names onto the front of these altered gift cards. In some cases, the conspirators used a label maker to affix the Card Verification Value (CVV) security code associated with the stolen account to the back of the counterfeit cards. The conspirators then used these counterfeit credit cards at various retailers around the Tampa Bay area.

<p>Earlier today, at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, Henry Fiorentino was sentenced to 22 years in prison by United States District Judge John Gleeson. Fiorentino was convicted after a two-week jury trial in November 2014 of conspiring to commit Hobbs Act robberies and conspiring to distribute cocaine and heroin.</p>

<p>The sentence was announced by Loretta E. Lynch, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.</p>

<p>Fiorentino was a leading member of a violent robbery crew responsible for more than 100 robberies of narcotics traffickers in the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere that netted more than 250 kilograms of cocaine and $1 million in drug proceeds. Beginning in approximately January 2001, crew members posed as law enforcement officers, staged fake arrests of the traffickers, and then forcibly seized the traffickers’ contraband. Members of the robbery crew restrained victims with handcuffs, rope, or duct tape and often brandished firearms and physically assaulted the victims. The Crew members then sold the stolen drugs and divided the proceeds among themselves.</p>

<p>Fiorentino participated in at least 19 separate robberies and attempted robberies. During these crimes, he personally entered the residences and, on numerous occasions, he or fellow crew members brandished firearms and abducted or restrained victims. During all of the robberies and attempted robberies, Fiorentino posed as a police officer. The robberies and attempted robberies in which Fiorentino directly participated involved at least 230 kilograms of cocaine and approximately $66,000 in drug proceeds.</p>

<p>Ms. Lynch extended her grateful appreciation to the Drug Enforcement Administration, New York, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, and the New York City Police Department.</p>

<p>The government’s case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Alexander Solomon and Sylvia Shweder.</p>
