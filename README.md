# CrossCompute Workshops

## How These Workshops Started

In an [article published on December 2011](http://www.governing.com/blogs/bfc/new-york-city-performance-data-analytics.html), John Feinblatt described how Mayor Bloomberg had tasked a team of analysts with the mission of prioritizing limited resources to solve city problems. Inspired by the article, I contacted Michael Flowers in February 2012 and offered to help.

For nine months on a mostly pro bono basis, I tried to persuade the team to use Python. I showed how easy it was to [merge tables using pandas, filter locations using pysal and make classifiers with scikit-learn](https://crosscompute.com/n/mclCK1IUHD67gF5JQ0l9SnBRM7yidp6v). Though I had previously experienced success from 2007 to 2011 in converting a research team at Columbia University to use Python, getting the analysts in the NYC Mayor's Office of Policy and Strategic Planning to actually use Python in their work was more difficult than I anticipated, despite official support and encouragement from the team.

The [original plan was for the analysts to share useful tools they made with open data on the CrossCompute platform for other analysts to run](http://news.crosscompute.com/post/18614886521/your-algorithm-can-be-useful-to-people-around-the-world). CrossCompute was designed as a platform for running user-contributed tools, analogous to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com) and [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store) but with a focus on open data and the public sector. However, creating a tool from start to finish was technically challenging on early versions of CrossCompute. After months of making example tools and preparing training material for the staff, I abandoned the original plan and instead spent most of my time experimenting with ways to make it easier for the analysts to publish their own tools.

By mid-2012, Accenture, SAS and Palatir were constructing a [cross-agency city data warehouse](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/analytics/initiatives/citywide-data-sharing.page) to parallel what had been done decades earlier in the private sector. I strongly believed that it would be easier to recruit city analysts if we made Jupyter Notebook available as a Python/R/Julia interface to the datasets in the warehouse and submitted a proposal in September 2012. Understandably, there was resistance from the stakeholders contractually obligated to build the city data warehouse as the open source languages and platforms presented a threat to the proprietary platforms involved. The official reason for rejecting the proposal was that there were security concerns in providing an alternate interface to the warehouse. I learned that technical merit alone could not sway decisions in large organizations and that government in particular was subject to a complex network of competing interests.

Frustrated by government processes, dwindling savings and pressure from Cathaleen (who did not want to live in New York), I refused an offer to develop the embryonic NYC Open Data initiative and instead opted to move to California and work in the private sector. I was careful to choose a position that would not be a conflict of interest with the CrossCompute platform and tools that I wanted to continue building. In January 2013, I chose to work as a Sales Engineer for Google AdSense in order to aid online publishers and gain a deeper understanding of the business aspect of technology. As intended, the role had minimal overlap with my experience building satellite image recognition and spatial optimization systems but also had minimal overlap with my motivations. Within weeks, I was miserable.

I could not find time to do what I really wanted to do

build a website where people could create and share tools that used open data to solve community problems

create tools

I really wanted to continue

I missed having the mission of demonstrating how to make tools using city data

I missed working next to a driven team whose mission was to demonstrate

I missed working a driven team whose mission was to demonstrate how to use city data to help city agencies

protect a city for whose population I cared deeply.

With approval from the company to work for a few weeks in New York in December 2013, I suggested a reunion of the [original team that had become the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/nyregion/mayor-bloombergs-geek-squad.html).

    talk about how the spatiotemporal analysis for community health and safety meetup started
    talk about how we had some events in California but how it was difficult to find a venue in New York

    talk about how olga wanted us to present at meetups and eventually host our own meetup
    talk about how in april 2017 olga had drafted a list of meetups where we could present
    talk about how we had difficulty presenting at other meetups specifically learn python nyc and nyc python meetup
